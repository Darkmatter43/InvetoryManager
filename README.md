# InvetoryManager
My final project as a student at General Assembly

## Ideas for now:
inventory management?
email notifications??? kinda nifty...
track orders and verify that everything has arrived when it should
think of a similar application used at my previous job - what features would I want to add, and which features would I like to emulate? Which features are extraneous / unncesseary?
